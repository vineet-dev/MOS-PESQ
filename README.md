# MOS-PESQ
ITU-T recommendation P.862 11/2015 publishes the reference implementation for MOS calculation.

The sources are freely available for download (however with license constraints) from ITU-T website at the following url: 
 - http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.862-200511-I!Amd2/en
 
This repository contains the 
- Makefile for unix environment.
- VS 2008 Solution file.

Unix make file can be used as it is by just renaming it and keeping inside the source folder.

For Window users VS 2008 solution file is also provided.

This is a sample implementation which can be used along with the source code published by ITU-T but the licence of ITU-T and copyrights 
of companies which own the reference implementation still implies. 
So, use this code solely for purpose for verification of P.862 reference implementation.
